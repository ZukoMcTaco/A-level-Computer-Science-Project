This is my A-level Computer Science Project.

This is a Flask web app which has a chatbot which has been trained using the pytorch library in python. The chatbot itself is built upon a 3 layer neural network containing 3 ReLU functions. 
In trained it on certain inputs within context to the project proposal I had which at the time involved creating a chatbot maid for the stakeholder of my A-level Computer Science Project.

The app uses Flask as a framework, and is built upon Jinja templates, alongside Bootstrap and some custom CSS. I also made use of JavaScript in order to communicate between the user and the chatbot as I fed the user's inputs to the chatbot
and the trained model generates a response to the user and based on its response, it will display an image of how the maid feels about the user's input i.e. if you say hi it will display a nice message with a happy image of the maid.
